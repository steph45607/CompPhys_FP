## Best Solar System (Gravity) Simulator

### Project Description

This simulator takes user input to place planets in coordinates around the sun. Using real-life physics, we are able to simulate acceleration due to gravity and gravity pull as well as adding an orbital tracer to show the distance between the sun and planets.
We use Python as our choice of language and uses libraries such as itertools, math and matplotlib.
